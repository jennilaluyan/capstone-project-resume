    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a fourth-semester student majoring in Informatics Engineering at Universitas Sam Ratulangi. I have a strong
        interest in Front-End Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. Although I still lack project experience, I
        have had many experiences in organizations, and have even led one of them. From these experiences, I have gained
        teamwork and leadership skills, which make me ready to study and implement what I have learned in upcoming
        projects.</p>
