    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Other than coding, I also love making films and theatrical acts. In fact, I have worked on a few projects for my
        church and participated in competitions.</p>
    <p>Watching movies and TV series has always been my favorite pastime since I was a child. According to my notes, I
        have watched more than 50 TV series. My favorite genres are comedy, action, superhero, drama, and thriller.</p>
    <p>During the quarantine of the coronavirus pandemic, I also found pleasure in playing video games, mostly on
        mobile, but some on PC as well. Recently, I played Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Wuthering Waves, Call of
        Duty: Mobile, Batman: Arkham Knights, and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>
